 <p>
   I&rsquo;m 19 years old and I split my time between Kansas City, San Francisco and Lincoln. I&rsquo;m a sucker for a good playlist and I always end up throwing Earl Sweatshirt on the same playlist as Tame Impala, The Kooks, Al Green and Mac Demarco. I love to dance, especially outside of the ballet studio. I&rsquo;m lucky enough to leave the Midwest every summer and trade the fields for waves. I&rsquo;m pathetically in love with the ocean and any opportunity I can get to head out there is one I can&rsquo;t turn down. 

Here are a few more facts so you can get to know me a little better:

<ol>
    
    <li>My last name is pronounced &quot;lucky&quot; (I promise)</li>
    <li>I&rsquo;m obsessed with tennis shoes and baseball caps</li>
    <li>When I was little I had my heart set on being an archeologist</li>
    <li>Stellar is one of my favorite words</li>
    <li>My proudest playlist is 728 songs long and isn&rsquo;t going to slow down anytime soon</li>
    <li>My best friend got me hooked on cuties, I swear I eat at least 3 of them a day</li>
    <li>I&rsquo;m convinced &quot;Going to California&quot; by Led Zeppelin is one of the most beautiful songs ever</li>
    <li>I dance all the time, especially when I&rsquo;m driving</li>
    <li>Speaking of driving, it&rsquo;s my favorite way to clear my head. Long drives and good music are the cure to almost anything</li>
    <li>My number one motivation at the moment is to get a dog named Marv (after the legendary original baby-making music maker, Marvin Gaye) and I have a collection of pup photos for potential candidates</li>
    
</ol>
